### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Part 2 of Lab 9 was a favorite for me because I was able to see how complex coding can get even for the simplest of games. This particular lab introduced reading in and out of files in order for the game to work, as the secret number would be stored in its own file and later on would be read from.

* Lab 10

    Part 1 of Lab 10 was at first very complicated for me to understand and grasp, but once I did, I was very satisfied finishing the code and accomplishing the task. I believe that learning and understanding how to work with 2D vectors will be a very useful skill.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was when I believe I started to understand and enjoy coding. Although the lab was very simple, I had begun to acknowledge and appreciate the complexity and ingenuity in the whole process of coding itself.
